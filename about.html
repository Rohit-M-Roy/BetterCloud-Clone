                    <p>We truly care about the people we interact with.
                         That’s why we act with empathy (by understanding their needs) 
                         and proactively (by anticipating their needs). 
                         We go the extra mile in all our interactions, 
                         striving to delight people with experiences that
                          are unexpected and memorable.

                    <p>We know we’re not perfect. So we listen with open ears and humility.
                         What we learn, we take to heart, and we never stop iterating. 
                         “Continuous improvement” is our default setting. That passion
                          fuels our drive to win—to stretch boundaries, challenge
                           the status quo, and keep raising the bar.

                         BetterCloud and SaaSOps. We’re all going after
                          this greater cause. The only way to make history 
                          is by doing it together, strengthened by diverse perspectives.
                           We act selflessly, leaning on each other for help.

                          our work. Since making a difference is what
