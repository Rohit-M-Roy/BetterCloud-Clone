                    <p>We truly care about the people we interact with.
                         That’s why we act with empathy (by understanding their needs) 
                         and proactively (by anticipating their needs). 
                         We go the extra mile in all our interactions, 
                         striving to delight people with experiences that
                          are unexpected and memorable.

                    <p>We know we’re not perfect. So we listen with open ears and humility.
                         What we learn, we take to heart, and we never stop iterating. 
                         “Continuous improvement” is our default setting. That passion
                          fuels our drive to win—to stretch boundaries, challenge
                           the status quo, and keep raising the bar.

                    <p>We (our team, our customers, our community) 
                        have two common threads that tie us together:
                         BetterCloud and SaaSOps. We’re all going after
                          this greater cause. The only way to make history 
                          is by doing it together, strengthened by diverse perspectives.
                           We act selflessly, leaning on each other for help.

                    <p>We don’t just do work for the sake of doing it.
                         We focus on what’s important: the outcomes of
                          our work. Since making a difference is what
                           drives us, we’re only satisfied when our
                            impact is real and meaningful.
